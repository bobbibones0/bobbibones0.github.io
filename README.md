Such things as selling or purchasing an account or server, participating in fraudulent Nitro incentives or Boosting activities, or using monetization features to commit fraud should not be done.

### 1.3 Do not promote, coordinate, or engage in harassment
Discord is a platform where everyone can find a place to belong, and harassment prevents users from building healthy communities. We do not allow harassing behavior such as sustained bullying, ban or block evasion, doxxing, or coordinating server joins for the purposes of harassing server members (such as server raiding).

# 2. Respect Others

### 2.1 Be chill
Refrain from arguing with others. Having different opinions about something in a heated or angry way is annoying for others, to stop fights like this, you can stop chatting or talk about a different topic.

### 2.2 Do not be discriminating, send death threats, or engage in hate speech
Joking about anything of these things will not let bypass this rule, saying something as a joke will not let you bypass the rules.

### 2.3 Do not share personal information
Sharing personal information is dangerous, therefore you should refrain from doing so. You may NEVER share ANY KIND of personal information about someone else. You may only share your own real name or email address.

# 3. No NSFW Content / Gore / Illegal Goods / E-dating

### 3.1 Do not talk about Sexual Activities
Talking about this topic is very inappropriate for our server, avoid any NSFL conversations (Not Save For Life)

Content including gore or illegal goods is strictly prohibited on our server. Any user sending content that involves graphic violence, explicit gore, or promotes illegal goods etc... will be punished.

### 3.3 No flirting and E-dating
Don't use our server for flirting and E-dating, especially minors can feel uncomfortable. **Discord is not a dating platform!**

If users report you doing this in DM, you will be punished. Them reporting it indicates that they don't want this.

### 3.4 Do not send any form of pornography or nudity, or gore
Any photos, videos, emotes, gifs of nudity, pornography or gore is not tolerated.

Additionally, trying to bypass this rule in any way is not allowed. Examples of this

### 3.5 Donâ€™t sexualize minors or joke about it
Any form of CP (Child Pornography) will result in an instant permanent ban and report to Discord.
